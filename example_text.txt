Hi, my name is Gilles Theodore Bang; I am a skillful player but not a noticeable player.
I am 180cm tall (With Hairs 187, with basketball shoes around 188 ==> 192 with Hairs) and weight currently 84kg. I can dribble the ball, pass the ball, shoot, and play decent Defense at all positions.
I am currently 26 years old, cannot dunk but can touch the ring. 
I am currently doing a Training course as an IT specialist in application development and although the training sounds easy, I am constantly afraid of not being formed well enough to be able to undertake a job after I am done. I have decided to start doing the following.
    • I need to play more selfishly in the offense
    • I play PG, SG, SF and PF
    • I need to become calmer in the offense to observe the defense when I play PF
    • I need to increase my court awareness
    • I need to increase my shooting ability
Tipps to improve my offense game:
    • Dribble the ball
    • Do not be afraid
    • Play all positions
    • Shoot when I am open and when they give me space
    • Always receive the ball in the Triple thread position
    • Always look at the ring at least once when I receive the ball
    • Always do a shot fake when I receive the ball
    • Pass only if I am doubled (Otherwise always go one on one)
    • On every offensive rebound try to put a putback
    • Bring the ball up if I get the rebound and it is a fast break situation. If it is one versus one go for it.
    • Do not stop dribbling the ball when penetrating if there are two potential help defenders
    • Score within the set plays
    • Always try to penetrate directly if guarded tightly
    • Shoot if given space (Punish)
    • Stop thinking about how to beat your opponent, just go with the quick first step and look at his reaction
    • Take at least 10 shots per game
    • Every time you receive the ball, take it in a triple thread position and count from 1 to 3. then think of a way to score. If you have space shoot. Just concentrate on scoring.
    • Always jump to your highest whatever the attack, always try to dunk
Tipps on defense:
    • Help Defense
        ◦ Always Block the middle pathway to the ring
        ◦ Come out to meet the player
        ◦ Do not jump
        ◦ Stay in the guard position
    • 1 on 1 defense
        ◦ Do not open up, slide 
        ◦ If you are late, follow by directing the person out (Do not open)
        ◦ Do not jump
        ◦ Always move your hands, go for steals but do not try to reach stupidly
        ◦ Defend the PG, SG, SF
    • Zone
        ◦ I like playing behind in the zone, I only chase if I have an equivalent work alcoholic ethical physical partner with me Infront
        ◦ I only go for breaks when sure the rebound will land, hence I need a Partner who will always go for breaks 

Monday 15.11.2021
Hi everyone, so today is another wonderful day. I slept at around 1-2 am in the morning just because I was too bored to sleep. I tried watching a review of the camera Job I did at the En-baskets game the day before. I simultaneously launched a stream of an NBA game (Hawks vs Bucks). I did not even watch the Milwaukee game for 4 Mins that I already had some masturbation urges. I guess every time I am really bored, I tend to masturbate myself. This time around I wanted to watch one of my actual favorite stars Kicki Minaj give a Rim job to someone and getting fucked hard in her anus. I also do not understand why, but as of recent I have been watching ebony Porns, I should really think about getting myself a Black girl outside just to have sex with her. The problem, however, with this solution is the fact that I do not even know if that is what I want. I just feel like everything is way too boring and my relation right now is a little boring too. 
In short, I masturbated. A funny part about me masturbating too recently is the fact that I tend to touch my anus, I want a girl to lick my ass while I masturbate. It is not as if, I feel something special about it, however just the thought of having a girls face in my ass is somehow turning me on. Guess it is a sort of act of domination, especially when you force her head down there. I feel like if my girl just licked my ass while I masturbate every 2 days it will be nice, but she is quite blunt about satisfying me. It is also not just that she is way too blunt in that aspect, but I am too insisting, or we are simply just too tired.
As mentioned, I watched these videos of Kicki Minaj. Is it that I am too excited? I cannot only watch one porn video and come from it. I always open like 20 tabs and watch 8 to 9 of the open videos before coming to the one I judged the most exciting of them all. To say the truth Kicki Minaj is dope, her body is ok, but she has a beautiful face, voice, and a sexy attitude. I waste approximately 20 mins every time I want to masturbate. 
Once I was done, I switched back to the games, logged in Netflix, played season one of the blacklists, turned the sound of the video off. I have no interest in watching this anymore, but I have tried multiple times telling Netflix that I do not more want to watch this, but it seems not to want to understand. I layed on the bed in the guest room, placed the mouse Infront of me and slept.
I then woke up around 4 o clock, the game was over, the computer was shining, the Serie had been paused because of Netflix asking me my approval of whether I wished to continue watching the series (why they do that I have no idea). In short, I clicked on continue, turned myself around and continued sleeping.
I woke up around 7:33, took my phone, verified my messages, read 2-4 manga updates, and since my phone's battery was extremely low, it went off. I got up went to my computer opened an incognito tab and this time around I wanted to watch girls fucking other girls while watching their asses bounce back and forth and getting fucked from another lesbian from behind. Yes, I was in the mood to watch the bouncing bubble assess. I however could not find many videos in this category and ended up watching some hentai too. The searching of the videos lasted like 7 mins and the masturbation 10-15 mins. By the time I came and cleaned myself it was 8:15. Nope, you guys are not wrong, my work starts at 8 am in the morning. But rather than getting up and preparing myself for work, I wasted time. I, however, then got up, looked for things to eat at work, took groundnuts, 4 mandarins, a knife, a pear and 2 kakis.
On my way to work I was impatient to show my fresh look to all my colleges. When I, however, came in, there were just a few remarks, and it was all. I was a bit disappointed, but I let it go, sat on my chair, turned the thermostat max in the room, brought out my food, brought out my water, wore my eyeglasses, thought briefly about the calendar that I am supposed to create for all events of my family, turned on my computer and started working.
At around 12:40, being done with two programs I was supposed to develop, rather than starting with the third on the list, I started thinking of what I could do, to waste some time. Thought about basketball,

For 2022, I will masturbate less, put in some work, change my team if I am pissed.
